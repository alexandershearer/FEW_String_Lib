## Here is a library I created to help with some basic string manipulation.

#### Added a few basic functions such as capitalize(), capitalizeWords(), capitalizeHeadline(), removeExtraSpaces() (currently not working), kabobCase(),
#### snakeCase(), camelCase(), shift(), makeHashTag(), and isEmpty(). 

#### These functions are for basic string manipulation. Getting started in my FEW class and learning the basics of libraries and packages.
